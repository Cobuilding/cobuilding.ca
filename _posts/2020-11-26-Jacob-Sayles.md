I am a creative and entrepreneurial technologist with over 20 years of experience and a history of innovative ideas, well executed projects, and management of diverse teams. In 2007, I recognized the growing trend of independent and remote workers and opened Office Nomads, the first coworking space in Seattle, WA. To support this business and others like it, I wrote Nadine, the first open source coworking platform, and founded Open Coworking, a non-profit dedicated to the Coworking Movement. In 2016 I relocated to Vancouver, Canada to take on the role of Director of Technology for 312 Main, a 105,000 sf coworking community in the old Downtown Vancouver Police building.

I am currently the Technical Director at Kanawha Design, a family run coworking design studio that supports small, medium, and large collaborative spaces with business planning, operations, community development, IT infrastructure, and the many uses of technology to support their memberships and communities.
