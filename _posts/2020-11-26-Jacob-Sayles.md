My primary focus over the past decade+ has been [coworking](https://coworking.org).
In 2007 I opened Office Nomads, the first coworking space in Seattle, WA. To
support this business and others like it, I wrote [Nadine](https://nadineproject.org),
the first open source coworking platform, and founded [Open Coworking](http://opencoworking.org),
a non-profit dedicated to the Coworking Movement. In 2016 I relocated to
Vancouver, Canada to take on the role of Director of Technology for
[312 Main](https://312main.ca), a Vancity Community Foundation community project
in the old Downtown Vancouver Police building.

I have also been activly involved with many housing projects.  In 2003
I lived in [Puget Ridge Cohousing](http://www.pugetridge.net) and was hooked on the
concept of intentional living.  Later I ran my own shared home known
affectionatly as The Purple for 14 years.  My wife and I worked on converting
[The Red Victorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Victorian) into a coliving
hotel in San Francisco, CA.  I continued to help out with software and reservation
systems for [The Embassy Network](https://embassynetwork.com).

I am currently the Technical Director at [Kanawha Design](https://kanawha.design),
a family run coworking design studio that supports small, medium, and large
collaborative spaces with business planning, operations, community development,
IT infrastructure, and the many uses of technology to support their memberships
and communities.
