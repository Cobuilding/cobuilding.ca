> BIRCH has partnered with Bowen Island Municipality to develop a community rental housing project on a portion of lot 3 of the community lands. The project will provide 25Â± units of secure rental housing for Bowen Island Community Members; units will be in a variety of sizes from studios, up to 3 bed family units (to be confirmed as we move through the phases of the project and secure funding). The building will be approx. 25,000 sq.ft., in a 4 story building (pending approval of a variance).
