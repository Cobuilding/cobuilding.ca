Hi! _cobuilding.ca_ is a new collaborative community for exploring collective ownership of housing: co-ops, co-housing, community land trusts, and more. We're call this "cobuilding" -- which you can think of as communities building together.

We're focused on finding a group of people and a shared space to own, live, and work in together in the Greater Vancouver area. Along the way, we're gathering info around other projects, financial structures, city-level initiatives, and more, and will be documenting and sharing what we find in a set of open source templates, so that other communities can build together.

"We" are currently Boris and Jacob. You can email us directly at _hello@cobuilding.ca_, or send us a message through the form below:
